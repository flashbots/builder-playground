# Builder Playground

The builder playground is a tool to deploy an end-to-end environment to locally test an Ethereum L1 builder. It deploys:

- A beacon node + validator client ([lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)).
- An execution client ([reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)).
- An in-memory [mev-boost-relay](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay).

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
$ go run main.go
```

The playground performs the following steps:

1. It attempts to download the `lighthouse` and `reth` binaries from the GitHub releases page if they are not found locally.
2. It generates the genesis artifacts for the chain.
   - 100 validators with 32 ETH each.
   - 10 prefunded accounts with 100 ETH each, generated with the mnemonic `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`.
   - It enables the Deneb fork at startup.
3. It deploys the chain services and the relay.
   - `Reth` node.
   - `Lighthouse` beacon node.
   - `Lighthouse` validator client.
   - `Mev-boost-relay`.
